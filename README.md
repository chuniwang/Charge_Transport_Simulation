My research investigates the charge transport mechanisms and properties in organic semiconductors. Since the dynamics of charge carriers in these materials are strongly affected by inter- and intra-molecular interactions, neither the charge-hopping model nor the band conduction model can accurately capture their transport properties. To address this challenge, I have developed ML schemes to predict charge transfer coupling (off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian) for organic semiconductors in condensed phase ([Link-1](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b04256), [Link-2](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0023697)). With these ML models, I have established a simulation framework that combines MD simulations, QC approaches, and ML techniques on the same computing platform. This framework offers a promising opportunity to explore the relationship between charge transport properties and the morphological structures of organic semiconductors. My work provides a better understanding of the charge transport mechanisms and properties in these materials, which can inform the design and development of more efficient organic semiconductors for various applications.
